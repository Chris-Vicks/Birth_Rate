# Birth_Rate

Introduction:
I wanted to take a look if education level played a part when women were having babies.  According to the CDC, in 2021, the birth rates for women in their early 20s declined and increased mostly in a woman's early 30s.  

The dataset that I am analyzing is the US births from 2016-2021 according to education level and age by state.  The purpose of this project is to provide a look into the value of education, bringing stability and marketability, over starting a family early or vice versa.

# Data Description

I used a dataset from Kaggle that provided me with the necessary data points that I needed for the project.  The data set was broken down into fields; State,	State Abbreviation,	Year,	Gender,	Education Level of Mother,	Education Level Code,	Number of Births,	Average Age of Mother (years), and	Average Birth Weight (g). This dataset has four quantitative fields: Education Level of Mother, Education Level Code, Number of Births, and Average Age of Mother (years).  The summarized category Average Birth Weight, will not be used for analysis.  There were no NAN values within the dataset. 

# Data Inquiry:

According to the dataset, one of the questions I asked myself was; At the highest levels of education are the birth rates increasing? and for anecdotal inquiry at what age are they having babies?  The age is a summarized field as the average age of the mother, though I used it as a snapshot it was not my major hypothesis.  I was looking for the trend in the US birth rate, the relationship between education level and birth rate, and whether people are deciding to have babies later in life based on education level.

# Project Value:

This project has value in the sense that it can help project the trend of the US population.  The value of understanding birthrate in relation to education level is useful because pursuing these higher education ranks could push having babies later in life.  As me and my wife did, we pursued higher education, my wife had our first baby at 32, second at 37, and third at 40.  This is important because at higher ages you become "High-risk", my wife was high risk due to age since our second baby, of course, there are other factors that I don't get into that cause high-risk status.

# Data Cleaning and Analysis:

I created functions to clean the dataset, I removed columns that I didn't need, state abbreviations, gender (of the baby), and baby weight.  I will insert graphs, visualizations, and data here.
