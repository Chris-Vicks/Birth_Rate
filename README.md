# Birth_Rate

Introduction:
I wanted to take a look if education level played a part when women were having babies.  According to the CDC, in 2021, the birth rates for women in their early 20s declined and increased mostly in a woman's early 30s.  

The dataset that I am analyzing is the US births from 2016-2021 according to education level and age by state.  The purpose of this project is to provide a look into the value of education, bringing stability and marketability, over starting a family early or vice versa.

# Data Description

I used a dataset from Kaggle that provided me with the necessary data points that I needed for the project.  The data set was broken down into fields; State,	State Abbreviation,	Year,	Gender,	Education Level of Mother,	Education Level Code,	Number of Births,	Average Age of Mother (years), and	Average Birth Weight (g). This dataset has four quantitative fields: Education Level of Mother, Education Level Code, Number of Births, and Average Age of Mother (years).  The summarized category Average Birth Weight, will not be used for analysis.  There were no NAN values within the dataset. 

# Data Inquiry:


Increase? Decrease? Birth rate dataset 









Describe the fields
There are three categories the dataset is broken into; State, Year,	Gender,	
There are four quantitative fields; Education, Level of Mother,	Education Level Code,	Number of Births,	Average Age of Mother (years),	and Average Birth Weight (g).
There are no NAN values in  the dataset
The data has two summarized categories; avg age of the mother and average birth weight but these two fields will not be used for my analysis.

Potential avenues of inquiry
Is the birth rate in the US decreasing?
Among what level of education are people having fewer or more babies?
Is there a correlation between education level and having babies?

Value proposition
Understanding the direction of the US population.  Are people deciding to have babies later in life and at what education level?
