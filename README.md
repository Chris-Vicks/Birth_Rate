# Birth_Rate
Increase? Decrease? Birth rate dataset 









Describe the fields
There are three categories the dataset is broken into; State, Year,	Gender,	
There are four quantitative fields; Education, Level of Mother,	Education Level Code,	Number of Births,	Average Age of Mother (years),	and Average Birth Weight (g).
There are no NAN values in  the dataset
The data has two summarized categories; avg age of the mother and average birth weight but these two fields will not be used for my analysis.

Potential avenues of inquiry
Is the birth rate in the US decreasing?
Among what level of education are people having fewer or more babies?
Is there a correlation between education level and having babies?

Value proposition
Understanding the direction of the US population.  Are people deciding to have babies later in life and at what education level?
